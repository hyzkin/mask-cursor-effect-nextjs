![demo image](./image.png)

This project demonstrates a smooth mask cursor effect using Framer Motion and NextJS. It leverages the animation capabilities of Framer Motion to create a dynamic and interactive cursor effect that follows the user's mouse movements.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyzkin/mask-cursor-effect-nextjs.git
   cd mask-cursor-effect-nextjs
   ```
